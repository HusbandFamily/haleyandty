            <p>Nearly 10 years ago, Ty and Haley fell for the hills of Tuscany, and subsequently, for each other.</p>
            <p>They dreamed of getting married here one day, and only in hindsight did they know that was their first vow.</p>
            <p>As love will have it, dreams sometimes do come true.</p>

                    <div class="column">
                        <div><h2>Is this my invitation?</h2> <p>Yes! But we will send you a detailed invite with all the information and details to RSVP in the coming weeks. For now, we’ve tried to answer some of the questions you’re already (probably) thinking about.</p></div>
                        <div><h2>Is it in Italy, actually?</h2> <p>Si, il es en Tuscano, Italia.</p></div>
                        <div><h2>Where in Tuscany is this wedding?</h2> <p>Our venue is in the Tuscan countryside at a beautiful vineyard on the top of a hill overlooking the rolling landscape. It’s located an hour south of Florence and about 30 minutes north of Sienna. We have reserved the property from Sept 29th to Oct 3rd. </p></div>

                    <div class="column">
                        <div><h2>When should I be there?</h2> <p>The ceremony is October 1st, but we are planning a few other events from Sept 29th to Oct 3rd. Festivities include a welcome event on Sept 29th, so consider joining us a few days early.</p></div>
                        <div><h2>How do I get there?</h2> <p>The closest airport is in Florence, an hour drive away, but you can also fly into Pisa (1.5hrs), Bologna (2hrs), or Rome (3hrs). We recommend renting a car upon arrival, as transit in the Tuscan hills is limited and driving is the best way to see everything Tuscany has to offer. However, there are a few train stations nearby our venue if you'd like to book a cab from those.</p></div>
                        <div><h2>Will you have spaghetti?</h2> <p>Yes, and plenty of wine to wash it down.</p></div>

                    <div class="column">
                        <div><h2>What about accommodation?</h2> <p>There is some, limited accommodation on our venue property for close friends and family, and many wonderful options nearby. We’ll provide more information about accommodation once official RSVPs are sent out.</p></div>
                        <div><h2>Already busy that day?</h2> <p>That’s okay, life happens. If you know you can’t make it, please let us know as soon as possible. We’ll be missing you though.</p></div>
                        <div><h2>My question isn’t here???</h2> <p>Feel free to send us a message with any questions you have, and we’ll try our best to answer them.</p></div>
